I created a metronome using React. None of my Dartmouth classes had a big web development component to it (to be precise, none). I wanted to experiment with HTML, CSS, and learn a bit of Javascript through React. I followed an online tutorial (https://daveceddia.com/react-practice-projects/) to build an online metronome. 

I decided to add an additional functionality of being able to change the meter between 4/4 and 3/4, which was not a part of the tutorial. I read through some React and Javascript documentation to add the functionality of toggling between the 2 choices. I ended up making this add-on work, but the only problem was that I could not change the tempo mid-playing. Ie. I had to pause the metronome, change the meter, and then start playing again.
