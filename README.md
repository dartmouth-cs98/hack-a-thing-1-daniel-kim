I created a metronome using React. None of my Dartmouth classes had a big web development component to it (to be precise, none). I wanted to experiment with HTML, CSS, and learn a bit of Javascript through React. I followed an online tutorial (https://daveceddia.com/react-practice-projects/) to build an online metronome. # hack-a-thing-1-daniel-kim
